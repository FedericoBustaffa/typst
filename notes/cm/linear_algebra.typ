Generally speaking, the #strong[linear algebra] defines rules to manipulate
#strong[vectors] by adding them together and multiply them by a scalar.

A vector can be many things, the most known type of vector is denoted as
$arrow(v)$ and it is used typically in physics; it can be seen as
$n$-dimensional point such that there is an #emph[arrow] starting from the
origin and pointing in that exact point. Also polynomials are vectors, but in
machine learning they are seen as elements of $bb(R)^n$.
