= Models Of Computation
<models-of-computation>
In order to better reason about algorithms and their theoritical
performances, #strong[models of computation] were defined. Typically
ideal models where overhead and heterogeneity of hardware is not taken
into account or modelled as something constant and simply predictable.

The three main models of computation are #strong[work span];,
#strong[pram] and #strong[bulk synchronous parallel];, each
characterizing some aspect of an algorithm and theoretical performance
or resource usage.
