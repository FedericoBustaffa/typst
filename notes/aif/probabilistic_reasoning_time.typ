= Probabilistic Reasoning over Time
<probabilistic-reasoning-over-time>
Many real world applications are not static, they need a
#strong[continual learning] approach. Under this vision of the modelled
world we can have two type of changes:

- #strong[Virtual drift];: the world keeps expanding but everything is
  happened before remains valid.
- #strong[Real drift];: the concepts change and the concepts happened
  before are not valid anymore.

In this sense we need a more powerful model capable of handling
#strong[changes over time];.

== Hidden Markov Model
<hidden-markov-model>
The #strong[hidden Markov model] is of course based on #strong[Markov
chains]
