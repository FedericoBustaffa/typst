= Complex Systems
<complex-systems>
A #strong[complex system] often refers to a system composed of simple
units, each exhibiting #strong[individual behavior];. However, when
these simple units are placed within the same system, they
#strong[interact];, giving rise to particular group behaviors known as
#strong[emergent] phenomena.

A #strong[computational model] is typically used to represent a complex
system, allowing certain behaviors to emerge through numerical
simulations.

The variables in these models evolve over time in a #strong[discrete] or
#strong[continuous] manner, and simulations can be either
#strong[deterministic] or #strong[stochastic];.

This type of study is generally contrasted with #emph[data-driven]
approaches (such as Machine Learning), providing instead a
#emph[knowledge-driven] approach, which requires fewer data but much
deeper knowledge of the system being studied.
