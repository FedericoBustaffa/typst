#title("Complex Systems")

A #strong[complex system] often refers to a system composed of simple units,
each exhibiting #strong[individual behavior];. However, when these simple units
are placed within the same system, they #strong[interact];, giving rise to
particular group behaviors known as #strong[emergent] phenomena.

A #strong[computational model] is typically used to represent a complex system,
allowing certain behaviors to emerge through numerical simulations.

The variables in these models evolve over time in a #strong[discrete] or
#strong[continuous] manner, and simulations can be either #strong[deterministic]
or #strong[stochastic];.

This type of study is generally contrasted with #emph[data-driven] approaches
(such as Machine Learning), providing instead a #emph[knowledge-driven]
approach, which requires fewer data but much deeper knowledge of the system
being studied.
